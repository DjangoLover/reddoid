# Reddoid

Reddoid is a mix between Planet and Reddit social media patterns.

Links and other entities (images, videos, events etc.) are pulled from sources curated by admins of each reddoid.
For now these can be Twitter and Google+, more in the future.

See [detailed documentation](http://dudarev.github.io/reddoid/) for more information.
